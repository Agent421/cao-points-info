**What is the CAO points system?** 

- CAO Stands for Central Applications Office

- They essentially process applications for Irish leaving cert students for third-level education.

- The tool above is targeted at senior Irish Secondary school students. This tool would be for Students from the 4th to 6th year.

- I am not affiliated with the Central Applications Office or the Irish education system.

**Why Use my tool?**

- When I was an Irish Leaving cert student it was frustrating and time-consuming to calculate an ideal grade requirement to reach a CAO points target.

- So I created this tool.

- The tool quickly outputs an ideal grade requirement to reach a CAO point target which also accounts for the amount of higher level and ordinary level subjects that the user does and then outputs the grade average required as a bonus.

- The tool saves time as it may be time-consuming to calculate a grade combination that you are comfortable with.

- The tool also completely FREE to use and doesn't retain any of the user's inputted information.

_**TLDR; The tool saves student's time, stress, and money.**_
